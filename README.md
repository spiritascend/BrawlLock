# BrawlLock

My friend and I were playing Brawlhalla, and we frequently accidentally tabbed out of the game even though the game was in full screen. So... I made a program that clips the cursor to the process window dimensions while still allowing you to tab out seamlessly so those accidental tab outs never occur again. It's life changing if you play Brawlhalla with keyboard and mouse.
