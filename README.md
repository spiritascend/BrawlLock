# BrawlLock

My friend and I were playing Brawlhalla, and we frequently accidentally tabbed out of the game even though the game was in full screen. So... I made a program that clips the cursor to the process window dimensions so that those accidental tab outs never occur again. It's life changing if you play Brawlhalla with keyboard and mouse.
